## Features 
### Infinite Autoplay Hero Slides
![Hero Slides](./read-me/Hero-Slides.png)
* The <a  href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel"  target="_blank">react-responsive-carousel</a> is used for the hero slider.
* Slide images transition every 4.5 seconds, with the last slide transitioning smoothly to the first image again. 
### Display Choice Images 
![Gallery Images](./read-me/Gallery-Imgs.png)
* An array of images is mapped to a CSS grid layout. 
* On image hover, an Instagram logo appears which would link to the post. 
### Add Item From Menu 
![Add Item](./read-me/Add-Menu.png)
* Clicking on each item pops up a control. A quantity of item can be chosen and added directly to the shopping bag. 
* localStorage (Web Storage API) prevents the shopping bag from resetting every time the page is refreshed. 
* Each time localStorage is updated, the shopping bag icon in the navigation bar relects the change in total item quantity. 
### Shopping Bag
![Shopping Bag](./read-me/Shopping-Bag-Features.png)
* Items added appear in the shopping bag from localStorage. 
* Bag functionalities include: change quantities, delete items, clear bag.
* Each bag function also modifies the state of the shopping bag in localStorage which then reflects to the navigation bar.  
* Check-out button is disabled if the shopping bag is empty. 
### Check Out 
![Check Out](./read-me/Check-Out-Feature.png)

### Responsive Design

<img src="/read-me/Mobile-Home.png" width="250" height="450" />
<img src="/read-me/Mobile-Gallery.png" width="250" height="450"  /> 
<img src="/read-me/Mobile-Menu.png" width="250" height="450" />
<img src="/read-me/Mobile-Bag.png" width="250" height="450" />
<img src="/read-me/Mobile-Check-Out.png" width="250" height="450" />
</p>

* This design scales down to mobile devices through CSS media queries. 

## Credit Card and Phone Number Real Time Formatting 
* The <a  href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phone-number-input"  target="_blank">react-phone-number-input</a> is used for phone number formattting 
* <a  href="https://stripe.com/"  target="_blank">Stripe</a> is used for front-end credit card number validation and formatting. A POST request to the Express server is sent at order submission which returns a response that triggers the loading of a confirmation message through React state. In this way, credit card validation and response was mocked. 

## Future Work 
* Store user input email into a database
* Add individual menu item description pages with pictures.
